# CS360_Mobile-Architect-and-Programming
- **Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**  
This project was to develop a mobile application for mobile Android devices. I chose to create weight-tracking applications.
This application creates three databases and is accessed locally on the user’s device. One database is for login information, one is for setting a goal weight for the user to achieve, and a third contains the user's weight history.
It uses a bottom navigation menu to cycle between the screens for setting goals and logging weight information. 

- **What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**  
The design used in this application was simple. It uses screen fragments to load the UI for each section and user touch interactions with text or buttons to instigate action within the application or navigate between the fragments. 

- **How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**  
I employed a slower and more thoughtful approach to coding this application. I found it challenging to remain focused at first and found that taking on one task at a time was more efficient for progress and reducing code errors.
I hope to plan out a course of action better and use that as a reference to align with deadlines or milestones.
Having a plan will also serve as a checklist that can be revised or amended as development progresses to ensure I have covered all aspects of the application functions and behaviors.

- **How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process necessary, and what did it reveal?**  
Testing was simple; it involved using a virtual device to load the application in its current state and manipulate it to reveal errors or behavior that was not within the scope of the application requirements. 

- **Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**  
I struggled with database implementation. I had a rudimentary understanding of what I needed the application to do regarding creation and CRUD methods.
I found several Android studio communities where this issue was identified and solved straightforwardly. I tried and tested several of these before I settled on one that gave my application the expected behavior.

- **In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**  
Overall, I think my application allowed a user to add a goal weight and continue to update their weight database and view their progress. I could adhere to the app’s requirements by keeping this application as simple as possible.
From having no experience in developing mobile applications to this simple application, I see success.
